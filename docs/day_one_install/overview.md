# Day One: Installing Linux Yourself

!!! tip "Get your own Linux playground running"

## Welcome, Future Linux Explorer

You want to learn Linux, but you don't have a server to practice on. Or maybe you've heard Linux is great for development, runs most of the internet, and powers everything from web servers to Raspberry Pi robots - and you're ready to dive in.

**Perfect. Let's get you set up.**

This guide will help you get Linux running on your own hardware, virtual machine, or even inside Windows. No server required. No risk of breaking production. Just you, Linux, and all the learning you can handle.

## Your Path Options

The beauty of Linux? You've got choices:

- **Virtual Machine** (VirtualBox/VMware) - Zero risk, snapshots for easy recovery, works on any OS
- **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) - Linux inside Windows, perfect for developers
- **Raspberry Pi** - Tiny computer, huge possibilities, ~$50
- **Laptop/Desktop Install** - Dual-boot or dedicated machine
- **Cloud** (AWS/Oracle/Azure) - Free tier options for remote learning

Don't know which to choose? We'll help you decide.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this path, you'll have:

- **Chosen the right installation method** for your needs and comfort level
- **Successfully installed Linux** on your chosen platform
- **Configured the basics** - updates, networking, essential tools
- **Troubleshot common issues** - WiFi, drivers, boot problems
- **Learned what to do next** - where to go from here

## Who This Is For

**Perfect for:**

- Students learning Linux for class or career
- Hobbyists wanting to tinker and learn
- Developers who want a local Linux environment
- Anyone curious about open source operating systems
- Parents setting up a Raspberry Pi with their kids

**Already have a Linux server?**

If someone gave you SSH credentials to an existing Linux server, check out [Day One: Logging Into Your Server](../day_one_server/overview.md) instead. That path is specifically for inherited/work servers.

## The Articles

Start with "Choosing Your Path," then jump to your installation method:

1. **[Choosing Your Path](choosing_path.md)** - Which installation is right for you?
2. **[Virtual Machine Setup](virtualbox.md)** - VirtualBox on Windows/Mac (safest option!)
3. **[WSL2 on Windows](wsl2.md)** - Linux inside Windows in 5 minutes
4. **[Raspberry Pi Setup](raspberry_pi.md)** - Headless setup, WiFi, SSH
5. **[Installing Ubuntu on Laptop](laptop_install.md)** - Dual-boot considerations
6. **[Installing Ubuntu on Desktop](desktop_install.md)** - Dedicated install, old PC revival
7. **[Post-Install Essentials](post_install.md)** - Updates, packages, configuration
8. **[Cloud Options](cloud_options.md)** - Free tier VMs in the cloud
9. **[Troubleshooting Common Issues](troubleshooting.md)** - Won't boot? WiFi broken? Start here.
10. **[Now What? Next Steps](next_steps.md)** - Your Linux is installed... what now?

## What's Next?

Once you've got Linux installed and running, head to [Level 1: Everyday Navigation](../level_1/overview.md). That's where you'll learn the essential commands you'll use every single day - moving around, managing files, getting help.

## The Philosophy

Throughout this path, we emphasize **low-risk learning**. Virtual machines are our favorite because you can snapshot before trying anything scary, then roll back if things go sideways. Even with physical installations, we'll show you how to test safely and recover when things don't go as planned.

**You learn Linux by using Linux.** Reading about commands is helpful, but actually typing them, making mistakes, and figuring things out? That's where real learning happens.

No judgment. No assumptions. Just clear instructions and the confidence to try things.

Ready? Let's get you a Linux environment to play with.
