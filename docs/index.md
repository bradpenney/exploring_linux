# Exploring Enterprise Linux

**From nervous SSH login to confident system administration.**

A subsection of [BradPenney.io](https://bradpenney.io), this site teaches practical Linux skills for developers and system administrators. It emphasizes real-world scenarios, production safety, and the "why" behind every command.

## Learning Path

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-login-variant: **[Day One - Getting Started](day_one/overview.md)**

    ---

    **[Getting Access](day_one/getting_access.md)** — SSH connection, local setup (WSL2, VirtualBox, Cloud)

    **[Orientation](day_one/orientation.md)** — First 60 seconds on a new server, system reconnaissance

    **Essential Skills** — Reading logs, finding documentation, common first tasks, safety guide *(coming soon)*

- :material-console-line: **Level 1 - Everyday Navigation** *(Coming Soon)*

    ---

    **Moving Around** — `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, directory navigation

    **File Management** — `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, creating and organizing

    **Viewing Files** — `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, reading file contents

- :material-magnify: **Level 2 - Finding & Filtering** *(Coming Soon)*

    ---

    **Searching** — `find`, `locate`, searching the filesystem

    **Text Processing** — `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, pattern matching

    **Pipes & Redirection** — Combining commands, shaping output

- :material-cog-outline: **Level 3 - Processes & Permissions** *(Coming Soon)*

    ---

    **Processes** — `ps`, `top`, `kill`, managing running programs

    **Permissions** — `chmod`, `chown`, file and directory access control

    **Users & Groups** — User management, sudo, access levels

- :material-server: **Level 4 - System Management** *(Coming Soon)*

    ---

    **Services** — `systemd`, `systemctl`, `journalctl`, service management

    **Networking** — IP configuration, DNS, SSH, firewall basics

    **Storage** — Filesystems, mounting, LVM, disk management

- :material-chip: **Level 5 - Under the Hood** *(Coming Soon)*

    ---

    **Boot Process** — GRUB, initramfs, systemd startup sequence

    **Kernel & /proc** — Understanding `/proc`, `/sys`, kernel parameters

    **Advanced Concepts** — Namespaces, cgroups, memory management

- :material-tools: **Level 6 - Special Topics** *(Coming Soon)*

    ---

    **Shell Scripting** — Bash scripts, automation, best practices

    **Containers** — Podman, Docker, rootless containers as services

    **Advanced Tools** — `tmux`, text editors, dotfiles, cron jobs

## Philosophy

This site teaches Linux with **production safety in mind**. Every article emphasizes:

- **Real-world scenarios** you'll encounter on actual servers
- **Safety-first approach** — when commands are dangerous and why
- **Purpose-driven learning** — understanding the "why," not just memorizing syntax
- **Progressive complexity** — from Day One orientation to system internals

Whether you just received SSH credentials to your first production server or you're deepening your Linux expertise, this site meets you where you are.
