# Automating Linux

Shell scripting is often called "the glue that holds the Internet
together." It's simple, but incredibly powerful — and used for everything
from archiving files to health checks to starting and stopping essential
apps and services in Enterprise Linux.

## Automating Environment Configuration

### Ansible

Ansible is a popular open-source automation tool. System administrators
and DevOps folks use it to simplify and streamline all sorts of IT tasks.
Its main job? Automate repetitive chores like software installs,
configuration management, app deployment, and system orchestration.

## Shell Scripting

### The Basics

Shell scripting skills are a lot like those in other languages — especially
Python (which sometimes replaces shell scripts) or PowerShell (Microsoft's
take on shell scripting!).

### Increasing Robustness

Once you've got the basics down, it's time to kick things up a notch and
make your scripts more robust.
