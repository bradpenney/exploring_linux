# Level 1: Everyday Navigation

!!! quote "The basics you'll reach for 100 times a day"

## Welcome to Level 1

You've got Linux running - whether that's a server you've logged into or a fresh install on your own machine. Now what?

**Now you learn the essentials.** The commands you'll type so often they become muscle memory. The tools that form the foundation of everything else you'll do on Linux.

This is where most people actually start learning Linux, and it's the perfect place to build confidence.

## What You'll Master

These are the fundamentals - moving around the filesystem, managing files, viewing content, and getting help when you're stuck:

- **Moving around** - `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`
- **File management** - `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`
- **Viewing files** - `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`
- **Getting help** - `man`, `--help`
- **Command-line shortcuts** - Work faster with keyboard magic

## Who This Level Is For

**Perfect for:**

- Anyone who just completed a Day One path
- People who've dabbled with Linux but want structured learning
- Developers who can navigate their IDE but get lost in the terminal
- Students starting their Linux journey

**Prerequisites:**

You should have access to a Linux environment - either a server you can SSH into or a local installation. If you don't have that yet, head back to [Day One: Logging Into Your Server](../day_one_server/overview.md) or [Day One: Installing Linux Yourself](../day_one_install/overview.md).

## The Skills

Work through these in order for the best learning experience:

1. **[Moving Around](moving_around.md)** - ls, cd, pwd - navigating directories
2. **[File Management](file_management.md)** - cp, mv, rm, mkdir - creating and organizing
3. **[Viewing Files](../basic_toolset/file_pagers.md)** - cat, less, head, tail - peeking inside
4. **[Getting Help](../getting_around/finding_help.md)** - man pages, --help, finding answers
5. **[Command Line Basics](../getting_around/using_the_command_line.md)** - Understanding the shell
6. **[BASH Shortcuts](../basic_toolset/BASH_shortcuts.md)** - Keyboard tricks for speed

## What's Next?

Once you're comfortable with these basics, you're ready for [Level 2: Finding & Filtering](../level_2/overview.md). That's where you'll learn to search for files, look inside them, and shape output - because searching is half of Linux life.

## The Philosophy

**Repetition builds mastery.** You won't remember everything from reading once. You'll remember it from typing `cd`, `ls`, and `cat` hundreds of times over the coming weeks.

Don't rush through this level. These commands are your foundation. The better you know them, the easier everything else becomes.

## Pro Tips

- **Practice on real tasks** - Don't just type commands randomly. Organize some files, explore a directory, read some logs.
- **Use tab completion** - Press Tab after typing part of a filename or command. It's a game-changer.
- **Make mistakes** - Seriously. Try the wrong thing. See what error messages look like. That's how you learn.
- **Keep this page bookmarked** - You'll reference these commands constantly at first. That's normal.
