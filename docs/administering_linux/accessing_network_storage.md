# Accessing Network Storage
One of the cornerstones of enterprise computing is letting systems share data
seamlessly. Enter NFS (Network File System): it lets clients pull from or write
to storage on a server as if it were local.

Classic use cases include:
- Applications writing logs to a central share
- Database servers sharing data files
- User home directories in large organizations

Whatever the use case, NFS makes life a lot easier.

??? note "Client-Side NFS Setup"

    This article covers accessing an existing NFS export. If you need to set
    up the server side first, see
    [Serving Up Network Storage](network_file_share_server.md).

## Finding an NFS Share

To see what a server is sharing, run:
``` bash title="Show NFS Exports"
# showmount -e <Name_of_NFS_Server> or <IP_of_NFS_Server>
showmount -e homeServer # OR
showmount -e 192.168.250.250
```

The result should resemble:
``` bash title="Sample NFS Export List"
Export list for homeServer:
/sharedSpace *
```

Once you know what‚Äôs available, you have two main choices for mounting it:
permanently or on-demand with automount.

## Option 1: Permanently Mounted
A permanent mount means the NFS share is always present in the
[Linux File System Hierarchy](../essential_concepts/filesystem_hierarchy.md).
To the client, it just looks like another directory.

- üëç Pros: always there, seamless for apps and users
- üëé Cons: if the NFS server is down, your client may hang or fail to boot

For enterprise systems with ‚Äúfive-nines‚Äù uptime, that tradeoff is usually fine.

### Install Client Packages

``` bash title="Install NFS Client Package"
dnf install nfs-utils # RHEL Family
apt install nfs-common # Debian Family
```

### Add to `/etc/fstab`
Always back it up first:

``` bash title="Backup /etc/fstab"
cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab_bkup
```

Then add:

``` bash title="Edit /etc/fstab"
# <NFS_Server_Name>:/<share_name>   /<mountPoint>   nfs     sync    0 0
homeServer:/                        /share          nfs     sync    0 0
```

### Validate the Mount
``` bash
mount -a # check if error thrown
mount | grep homeServer # should return some lines
findmnt --verify # should return no issues
```

If all looks good, reboot and confirm it mounts automatically.

## Option 2: Automount
Automounting makes shares available on demand ‚Äî they appear only when accessed,
and disappear when idle.

This is great for:

- User home directories (only mount them when someone logs in)
- Occasional writes (e.g., daily log dumps)
- Reducing overhead when constant connectivity isn‚Äôt needed

From a user‚Äôs perspective: it ‚Äújust works‚Äù when they need it, but doesn‚Äôt
clutter the system otherwise.

### Install and enable `autofs`

``` bash
dnf install autofs # RHEL Family
apt install autofs # Debian Family

# Enable the service
systemctl enable --now autofs
```

??? warning "Restart Required After Config Changes"

    Remember: restart autofs every time you change its config:

    ``` bash title="Restart autofs"
    systemctl restart autofs
    ```

### Configure Automount
Automount uses at least two files:
- `/etc/auto.master` ‚Üí defines the mount point and its map file
- `/etc/auto.<shortName>` ‚Üí the specific config for that share

Example:

`/etc/auto.master`:

``` bash title="Sample /etc/auto.master"
# /etc/auto.master
# /<mountPoint> /etc/auto.<configFile>
/share  /etc/auto.share
```

`/etc/auto.share`:

``` bash title="Sample /etc/auto.share"
# /etc/auto.share
# <wildcard> <read/write> <location>
*   -rw     homeServer:/sharedSpace/&
```

### How it Works
- The server homeServer shares `/sharedSpace`.
- Clients don‚Äôt see subdirectories until they‚Äôre accessed (i.e.
`/share/backups`).

## Conclusion

Whether you go with permanent mounts or automount, NFS is a fundamental tool
for enterprise admins. It extends the filesystem across machines, making your infrastructure far more flexible and powerful.
