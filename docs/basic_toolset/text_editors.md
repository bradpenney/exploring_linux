Command Line Text Editors

If you spend any time on the command line, you’ll eventually need to edit text
files. Configs, scripts, logs — they all come up sooner or later. Having a good
text editor at your fingertips isn’t just handy, it’s essential.

Here are the usual suspects you’ll run into:

## Nano 🍼
- Super beginner-friendly. You can open a file and start typing — no weird
  key combos required.
- Great for quick edits, but pretty limited compared to the big players.
- Old-school sysadmins sometimes roll their eyes when they see someone using
  Nano (“rookie move!”).
- Installed by default on basically every Linux distro, so it’s always there
  as a fallback.

Think of Nano as the training wheels of text editors — nothing wrong with it,
but you’ll probably outgrow it.

## Vi / Vim ⚡
- The industry standard for editing files in Linux. If you’re serious about
  command line work, Vim is the one to know.
- On most modern systems, typing `vi` actually launches `vim` (a supercharged
  version of the original `vi`).
- Some older UNIX systems still use the plain `vi`, so it’s worth knowing the
  basics.
- Always available — it’s installed on every Linux system by default.

Yes, Vim has a bit of a learning curve. Yes, you will forget how to quit at
least once. But once you learn the ropes, it’s incredibly powerful and fast.
(Your future self will thank you.)

## Emacs 🧠
- Another legendary editor, though not nearly as common in Enterprise Linux
  land.
- Developers tend to love it more than sysadmins.
- Learning curve? Steep. But the documentation is fantastic.
- Usually not installed by default, so you’ll have to add it yourself if you
  want to give it a spin.

Emacs isn’t just an editor — some folks basically live inside it. (Email,
calendar, games… you name it.) It’s a rabbit hole, but a fun one if you’re
curious.

## 👉 Bottom Line
- Nano is the quick and easy option.
- Vim is the go-to tool every sysadmin is expected to know.
- Emacs is powerful but niche, especially on enterprise systems.
